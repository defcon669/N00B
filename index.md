This site is a work in progress so please excuse the lack of content.  As things are added to the site, the end result will be astonishing.

[Click Here for the slightly ever-so-interactive React checklist](./another-page.html).

For your entertainment, while very brief take a look at the link above for something oddly... interesting to interact with.

# Whatever you do, don't snag any content or replicate this site whatsoever.  Github is on top of it.

If you ever have the time and want to peruse regarding a free COVID-19 course...

go to [https://ibginstitute.com/](./https://ibginstitute.com/)

There is where the information can be found.  While it won't be given away by yours truly, I'll leave the navigation and search up to you.  I want you to look for the course and enroll on your own, if interested.  Keep in mind, it's a self-paced course and for the most part it's self-taught minus the lectures twice a week.  

##Take the below in stride or with a pinch of salt.  Which ever you choose, is up to you.
